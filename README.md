# trRosetta for protein design (trDesign)

The package summarizes developments on the use of [trRosetta](https://github.com/gjoni/trRosetta) 
structure prediction network for various protein design applications. We provide core codes for the 
following papers:

[01] (paper1) De novo protein design by deep network hallucination.

[02] (paper2) Protein sequence design by explicit energy landscape optimization.

[03] (paper3) De novo design of protein scaffolding for discontinuous functional sites using deep learning.
